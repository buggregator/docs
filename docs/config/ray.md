# Integration â€” Spatie Ray

[Ray](https://myray.app/) is a debug tool that was created by Spatie. It is a great alternative to the Symfony
VarDumper component especially for Laravel applications. Buggregator is compatible with the Ray, and it's a good free
alternative for debugging your applications.

> **Note:** Some of the features of Ray are not available in Buggregator, like colors, sizes, and other visual features.

Ray provides packages for PHP, Ruby, JavaScript, TypeScript, NodeJS, Go, and Bash applications. So using it you can
dump variables in many languages straight to the Buggregator.

## Laravel

Please make sure `ray.php` config published to the project root.

You can run an artisan command to publish it in to the project root.

```bash
php artisan ray:publish-config
```

**Env variables**

```
RAY_HOST=ray@127.0.0.1  # Ray server host (Current HTTP buggregator port)
RAY_PORT=8000           # Ray server port
```

## Framework-agnostic PHP

In framework-agnostic projects you can use this template as the ray config file.

```php
<?php
// Save this in a file called "ray.php"

return [
    /*
    * This settings controls whether data should be sent to Ray.
    */
    'enable' => true,

    /*
     *  The host used to communicate with the Ray app.
     */
    'host' => 'ray@127.0.0.1',

    /*
     *  The port number used to communicate with the Ray app.
     */
    'port' => 8000,

    /*
     *  Absolute base path for your sites or projects in Homestead, Vagrant, Docker, or another remote development server.
     */
    'remote_path' => null,

    /*
     *  Absolute base path for your sites or projects on your local computer where your IDE or code editor is running on.
     */
    'local_path' => null,

    /*
     * When this setting is enabled, the package will not try to format values sent to Ray.
     */
    'always_send_raw_values' => false,
];
```

That's it! Now you can use the `ray()` function as usual. The output will be sent to the remote server.
