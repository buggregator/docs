# What is Buggregator?

[Buggregator](https://github.com/buggregator/server) is a free, multi-purpose server tool designed primarily for
debugging PHP applications, but it's also compatible with other programming languages. Think of it as a Swiss Army knife
for developers. What makes it special is that it offers a range of features that you would usually find in various paid
tools, but it's available for free.

One of the coolest things about Buggregator is how well it fits into Docker environments. If you're working with Docker,
it is like a dream come true. It's easy to integrate and really powerful.

The key feature of Buggregator is its ability to bring together debugging information from different services. This
means you can see all your debugging data in one place, which makes fixing bugs a whole lot easier and faster. It's a
great tool for any developer looking to streamline their debugging process without spending a lot of money.

If you don't have Docker or you need debug your local PHP application with **Zero Configuration** just
use [Buggregator Trap](./trap/what-is-trap.md). It's a lightweight alternative to the full Buggregator server, designed
for local debugging.

## What makes it special?

1. **Unified Debugging Dashboard**: It allows you to aggregate logs, dumps, and other debug information from
   all your services into a single, unified interface. This centralization of data is invaluable for developers who
   manage multiple services or microservices, as it simplifies tracking and analysis.

2. **Cross-Service Debugging**: It eliminates the need to toggle between different tools or logs, saving time and
   reducing complexity.

3. **Real-Time Monitoring on Various Devices**: You can open its GUI on different devices, such as a tablet, and observe
   all the debug information in real-time.

4. **Ease of Access and Use**: By integrating Buggregator into your Docker development infrastructure, you set up a
   system where all debug information is automatically sent to Buggregator's server.

5. **Kubernetes Compatibility**: Deploy Buggregator in your Kubernetes cluster to enhance debugging and operational
   efficiency.

6. **SSO support**: Securely manage user access and authentication through Single Sign-On (SSO) with providers like
   [Auth0](https://auth0.com/).

7. **External database support**: Configure Buggregator to use external databases like MongoDB or PostgreSQL for event
   storage. This flexibility allows you to scale storage according to your project needs.

8. **Full source code available**: Buggregator is open-source, so you can customize it to suit your requirements or
   contribute to its development.

9. **Free to use**: Buggregator is free to use, making it an accessible and cost-effective solution for developers.
