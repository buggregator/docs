# Contributing â€” Frontend side

[The Frontend Part](https://github.com/buggregator/frontend) is what users interact with. It displays the events and
information processed by the server in a user-friendly way. Users can see live updates of events like errors or logs.

## Key Technologies:

- [VueJs 3](https://v3.vuejs.org/) - This framework builds the interactive user interface.
- [TailwindCSS](https://tailwindcss.com/) - Styles the frontend, making it look good and responsive.
- [Storybook](https://storybook.js.org/) - Helps us develop and organize UI components.

This architecture supports a robust system for monitoring and managing application events. As a contributor, your work
in either part plays a crucial role in enhancing Buggregator's functionality and user experience. If you have any
specific areas you're interested in or questions about the architecture, feel free to ask!
